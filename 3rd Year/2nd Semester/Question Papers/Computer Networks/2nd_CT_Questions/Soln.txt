There is an error in this packet. The 4 left-most 
bits (0100) show the version, which is correct. 
The next 4 bits (0010) show the header length, 
which means (2 × 4 byte words = 8 bytes), which 
is wrong. The minimum number of bytes in the 
header must be 20. The packet has been corrupted 
in transmission.
